# Integrate OpenAI with Slack using MuleSoft

This is a MuleSoft project showing how to integrate OpenAI with Slack. This requires the [OpenAI Connector](https://github.com/djuang1/openai-connector) in order to work. You also need a OpenAI account for the API token and a Slack account to create a bot.

A video of this solution can be found on Youtube below.
